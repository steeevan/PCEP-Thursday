Here are 10 Python problems where the goal is to determine the output when a list is sliced in different ways:

---

### **Problem 1**

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(nums[2:5])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 2**

```python
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
print(letters[:4])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 3**

```python
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
print(data[1:7:2])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 4**

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
print(fruits[-3:])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 5**

```python
numbers = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700]
print(numbers[::-1])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 6**

```python
values = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]
print(values[::3])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 7**

```python
sequence = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
print(sequence[1:-1:2])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 8**

```python
items = ["pen", "pencil", "eraser", "ruler", "marker", "notebook"]
print(items[-5:-2])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 9**

```python
nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]
print(nums[::])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 10**

```python
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple", "orange"]
print(colors[-1:-4:-1])
```

**What is the output?**
