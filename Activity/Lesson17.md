Here are 10 Python problems where the goal is to determine the output when a list is sliced in different ways:

---

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(nums[2:5])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 2**

```python
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
print(letters[:4])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 3**

```python
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
print(data[1:7:2])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 4**

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
print(fruits[-3:])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 5**

```python
numbers = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700]
print(numbers[::-1])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 6**

```python
values = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]
print(values[::3])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 7**

```python
sequence = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
print(sequence[1:-1:2])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 8**

```python
items = ["pen", "pencil", "eraser", "ruler", "marker", "notebook"]
print(items[-5:-2])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 9**

```python
nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16]
print(nums[::])
```

**What is the output?**

---

### **Problem 10**

```python
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple", "orange"]
print(colors[-1:-4:-1])
```

**What is the output?**

These problems cover various list slicing concepts including positive and negative indices, step values, and reversing lists. Let me know if you need solutions or explanations! ðŸš€




Here are 10 problems where students must determine the output by working through Python list slicing manually:

---

### **Problem 1**

A list contains numbers from 1 to 9:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(nums[1:6:2])
```

**What is the output?**

âœŽ **Work it out by hand before checking with Python.**

---

### **Problem 2**

A list of characters:

```python
chars = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H']
print(chars[:5])
```

**What is the output?**

âœŽ **Solve this manually.**

---

### **Problem 3**

A list with multiples of 10:

```python
values = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
print(values[2:8:3])
```

**What is the output?**

âœŽ **Write the steps before checking in Python.**

---

### **Problem 4**

A list of common fruits:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry", "fig", "grape"]
print(fruits[-5:-1])
```

**What is the output?**

âœŽ **Trace the indices before running it.**

---

### **Problem 5**

A list of animals:

```python
animals = ["dog", "cat", "lion", "tiger", "bear", "wolf", "elephant"]
print(animals[::-2])
```

**What is the output?**

âœŽ **Break down how the slicing works.**

---

### **Problem 6**

A list of even numbers:

```python
evens = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
print(evens[::4])
```

**What is the output?**

âœŽ **Calculate it manually first.**

---

### **Problem 7**

A list with the alphabet:

```python
alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']
print(alphabet[5::-2])
```

**What is the output?**

âœŽ **Work through the indices carefully.**

---

### **Problem 8**

A list of sports:

```python
sports = ["soccer", "basketball", "tennis", "golf", "volleyball", "swimming", "hockey"]
print(sports[1:-2])
```

**What is the output?**

âœŽ **Determine which elements will be included.**

---

### **Problem 9**

A list of prime numbers:

```python
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
print(primes[-3:])
```

**What is the output?**

âœŽ **Analyze the negative indices before checking in Python.**

---

### **Problem 10**

A list with colors:

```python
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "purple", "orange", "black"]
print(colors[-2:-5:-1])
```

**What is the output?**

âœŽ **Manually list the selected elements.**

---

### **Instructions for Students:**

* **Do NOT run the code immediately!**
* **Write out the list indices manually.**
* **Identify which elements are included in the slice.**
* **Check your answer only after working it out by hand.**

This ensures strong **list slicing** skills in Python! Let me know if you want me to include solutions or explanations! ðŸš€
