### Word Problems for Practice

**1. Find Unique Characters in a String**

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of characters that appear only once in the string. Ignore case and non-alphanumeric characters.

**Example:**

```python
Input: "LeetCode"
Output: ['L', 't', 'o']
```

---

**2. Product of All Elements Except Self**

Given an array of integers `nums`, return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`. Solve this without using division and in `O(n)` time complexity.

**Example:**

```python
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]
```

---

**3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example:**

```python
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3  # The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

---

**4. Merge Two Sorted Lists**

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`. Merge the two lists in a single sorted linked list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. Return the head of the merged linked list.

**Example:**

```python
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

---

**5. Two Sum**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

**Example:**

```python
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
```

---

**6. Valid Parentheses**

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

**Example:**

```python
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

---

**7. Search Insert Position**

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

**Example:**

```python
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
```

---

**8. Binary Search**

Write a function that takes a sorted list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. Return the index of `target` if it exists, otherwise return `-1`. Solve this using the binary search algorithm.

**Example:**

```python
Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 9
Output: 4

Input: nums = [-1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 12], target = 2
Output: -1
```

---

**9. Maximum Subarray**

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

```python
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6  # [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

---

**10. Find the Missing Number**

You are given an array containing `n` distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`. Find the one that is missing.

**Example:**

```python
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```

These problems mimic LeetCode-style challenges and are designed to test problem-solving skills involving loops, data structures, and algorithmic thinking.
