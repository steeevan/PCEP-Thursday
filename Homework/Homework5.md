# Homework Assignment: Tuples, Dictionaries, and Strings

## Instructions:
Complete the following exercises using tuples, dictionaries, and strings in Python. Ensure your code is well-documented with comments explaining the logic of your solutions.

---

### **Exercise 1: Tuple Operations**
Create a tuple with 10 numbers and perform the following:
1. Print the length of the tuple.
2. Access the first three elements using slicing.
3. Reverse the tuple and print it.

---

### **Exercise 2: Dictionary Manipulation**
Create a dictionary that stores the names and ages of five people. Perform the following:
1. Add a new person to the dictionary.
2. Remove a person from the dictionary.
3. Print the name of the oldest person in the dictionary.

---

### **Exercise 3: String Transformation**
Write a program that takes a string and does the following:
1. Convert all characters to uppercase.
2. Remove any digits from the string.
3. Replace all vowels with the symbol "*".
4. Print the modified string.

---

### **Exercise 4: Tuple to Dictionary Conversion**
You are given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a student's name and their grade. Convert this list into a dictionary where the student names are the keys and their grades are the values. Print the resulting dictionary.

Example:
```python
students = [('John', 85), ('Alice', 92), ('Bob', 78)]
```

---

### **Exercise 5: Inverting a Dictionary**
You are given a dictionary where the keys are names and the values are ages. Modify the dictionary so that the keys are ages and the values are lists of names corresponding to each age. Print the modified dictionary.

Example:
```python
ages = {'Alice': 30, 'Bob': 25, 'Charlie': 30, 'Diana': 22}
```

---

### **Exercise 6: Checking Palindromes**
Write a program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome (a word that reads the same forward and backward). Ignore spaces and capitalization. Print "Palindrome" if true and "Not a palindrome" otherwise.

Example:
```python
"A man a plan a canal Panama"
```

---

### **Exercise 7: Word Counting**
Given a sentence, count how many times each word appears and store the result in a dictionary. Print the dictionary.

Example:
```python
sentence = "This is a test. This test is only a test."
```

---

### **Exercise 8: Most Frequent Character**
Write a program that takes a string and prints the most frequent character (excluding spaces).

Example:
```python
text = "hello world"
```

---

### **Exercise 9: Merging Dictionaries**
You are given two dictionaries. Merge them into one dictionary. If a key exists in both dictionaries, add their values together. Print the resulting dictionary.

Example:
```python
dict1 = {'a': 100, 'b': 200}
dict2 = {'a': 300, 'c': 400}
```

---

### **Exercise 10: Tuple Packing and Unpacking**
Create two tuples, each containing three items (e.g., a name, an age, and a city). Perform the following:
1. Combine the tuples into a single tuple using tuple packing.
2. Separate the combined tuple back into individual variables using tuple unpacking.
3. Print the combined tuple and then print the individual items.

This set of 10 exercises avoids asking students to define functions and instead focuses on writing full programs or small blocks of code. Let me know if this works for your students!
