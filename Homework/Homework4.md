### Homework Assignment: Python Data Structures

#### **Objective:**
This assignment will assess your understanding of Python’s data structures, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings. You will practice operations such as slicing, indexing, list methods, and comprehensions. Ensure you attempt each question and write clean, well-commented code.

---

### **Part 1: Lists**

1. **List Slicing**  
   You are given the list:  
   ```python
   numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
   ```  
   - Extract every second element starting from the second element (i.e., 20, 40, 60, …).
   - Extract the last four elements of the list.
   - Reverse the list using slicing.

2. **List Methods**  
   Given the list:  
   ```python
   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "fig", "grape"]
   ```  
   Perform the following tasks:
   - Add "kiwi" to the end of the list.
   - Insert "orange" at index 2.
   - Remove "banana" from the list.
   - Sort the list alphabetically.
   - Count how many times "cherry" appears in the list.

3. **List Comprehension**  
   Using list comprehension, create a list of the squares of all even numbers between 1 and 20 (inclusive).

### **Part 2: Tuples**

1. You are given the tuple:
   ```python
   student_data = ("John", 18, "Physics", "A")
   ```
   - Extract the name and grade from the tuple.
   - Convert the tuple into a list, modify the age to 19, and convert it back to a tuple.

2. Create a tuple of 5 different fruits. Write a function that takes a tuple and returns the fruits that start with the letter ‘a’.

### **Part 3: Dictionaries**

1. You are given a dictionary of student names and their scores:
   ```python
   students_scores = {
       "Alice": 85,
       "Bob": 78,
       "Clara": 92,
       "David": 88,
       "Eva": 74
   }
   ```
   - Add a new student "Frank" with a score of 90.
   - Update "Eva’s" score to 80.
   - Print the score of "Clara."
   - Remove "Bob" from the dictionary.
   - Calculate and print the average score of all students.

2. **Processing Data Using a Dictionary**  
   Given the dictionary:
   ```python
   inventory = {
       "apple": 10,
       "banana": 20,
       "cherry": 15,
       "date": 5
   }
   ```
   - Write a function that takes this dictionary and returns a list of all fruits with more than 10 in stock.

---

### **Part 4: Strings**

1. You are given the string:
   ```python
   sentence = "Python programming is fun and powerful."
   ```
   - Convert the string to uppercase.
   - Count how many words are in the sentence.
   - Replace the word "fun" with "exciting."
   - Extract the word "powerful" from the string using slicing.

2. Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (a word that reads the same forwards and backwards, e.g., "radar").

---

### **Part 5: Challenge Problem (Optional)**

1. **List and String Manipulation**  
   You are given a sentence in the form of a list:
   ```python
   sentence_list = ["Python", "is", "a", "fun", "language", "to", "learn"]
   ```
   - Reverse the order of the words in the list.
   - Convert the list into a single string where the words are separated by spaces.
   - Print the length of the new string.

---

#### **Submission:**
- Submit your assignment as a `.py` file or a Jupyter Notebook.
- Make sure to include comments explaining your code.
- For each task, print the output to verify your solution.

---

#### **Grading Criteria:**
- Correctness: Solutions meet the problem requirements.
- Code readability: Solutions are well-commented and easy to understand.
- Efficiency: The code avoids unnecessary operations.
