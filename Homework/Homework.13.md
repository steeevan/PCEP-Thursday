**Homework Assignment: Lists in Python**

**Objective:**

The goal of this assignment is to practice working with lists and performing basic operations like indexing, slicing, and applying loops. Complete each problem below using Python.

---

**Problem 1: Reverse a List**

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order.

Example Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

Example Output: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

---

**Problem 2: Find All Divisible Numbers**

Write a function that takes a list of integers and a divisor, and returns a list of numbers that are divisible by the given divisor.

Example Input: `nums = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]`, `divisor = 5`

Example Output: `[10, 15, 20, 25, 30]`

---

**Problem 3: Count Occurrences of a Word**

Write a function that takes a list of words and a target word, and returns the number of times the target word appears in the list.

Example Input: `words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"]`, `target_word = "apple"`

Example Output: `3`

---

**Problem 4: Replace Negative Numbers with Zero**

Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list where all negative numbers are replaced with zero.

Example Input: `[-1, 2, -3, 4, -5]`

Example Output: `[0, 2, 0, 4, 0]`

---

**Problem 5: Combine Two Lists Alternately**

Write a function that takes two lists of equal length and returns a new list where the elements alternate between the two lists.

Example Input: `list1 = [1, 3, 5]`, `list2 = [2, 4, 6]`

Example Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`

---

**Problem 6: Find the Index of the First Occurrence**

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and a target value, and returns the index of the first occurrence of that value in the list. If the target value is not found, return -1.

Example Input: `nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, `target = 30`

Example Output: `2`

---

**Problem 7: Generate a List of Squares**

Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing the square of each number.

Example Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

Example Output: `[1, 4, 9, 16]`

---

**Problem 8: Find the Most Frequent Item**

Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns the string that appears most frequently. If there is a tie, return any of the most frequent strings.

Example Input: `["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "apple", "banana"]`

Example Output: `"apple"`

---

**Problem 9: Remove All Zeroes**

Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with all zeroes removed.

Example Input: `[0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4]`

Example Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`

---

**Problem 10: Split a List into Two Equal Halves**

Write a function that takes a list and splits it into two equal halves. If the list length is odd, the first half should have one more element.

Example Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

Example Output: `[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]`
